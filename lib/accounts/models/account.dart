/// Represents a credit card account with balance, limit, and usage information.

/// This immutable data class encapsulates all essential account information
/// including financial details, dates, and computed metrics like usage percentage.
/// 
/// Financial amounts are stored in cents to avoid floating-point precision
/// issues when performing calculations. The [Money] class from the money2
/// package is used for display and formatting.

/// Usage percentage is automatically calculated as balance รท limit, providing

/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final account = Account(
///   uid: 'chase-freedom-001',
///   dateAdded: DateTime(2023, 1, 15),
///   name: 'Chase Freedom Unlimited',
///   balanceInCents: 125000,  // $1,250.00
